Case.create(case_title: "Bt Talong", case_content: "The decision of the Supreme Court last December to simultaneously ban the field testing of Bt talong and nullify the existing government biosafety guidelines has dire implications for scientific progress, and thus, economic development and welfare, raising very serious concerns in the scientific community. Leading Filipino experts in biotechnology, microbiology, biochemistry and other related fields both in the country and abroad have come together to inform the public and to vouch for the safety of Bt talong and its testing procedures. The hope is that with the unsubstantiated fears allayed, the discussion may move on to its implications for food security, economic development and poverty alleviationâ€”issues that have been at the very heart of scientific motivation for the research and development on Bt talong and other genetically modified products of biotechnology.");
