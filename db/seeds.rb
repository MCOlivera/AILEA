<p>MOTION TO LIFT WARRANT OF ARREST</p>

<p> ACCUSED, through counsel, respectfully moves for the lifting of the Order for issuance of warrant for his arrest issued on June 24, 2014 (copy of which is hereto attached as Annex &quot;A&quot;) on the following grounds:</p>

<p>1. Accused was never served a copy of the complaint filed against him. The records will show that he did not receive it nor was it received by a duly authorized rep. A copy of the sheriff's return is hereto attached as Annex &quot;B&quot;;</p>

<p>2. The records will show that the accused was never served any copy of a subpoena or notice of hearing at any stage of the proceedings. All notices appear to have been delivered in a business establishment used to be rented by the accused in the past which had already been closed and unoccupied long before the process was served;</p>

<p>3. Accused was likewise not served a notice of arraignment;</p>

<p>4. Accused was therefore, not given an opportunity to be heard and effectively deprived of his constitutional right to due process.</p>

<p>PRAYER</p>

<p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed unto this Honorable Court to reconsider its Order of June 24, 2015 and lift the warrant of arrest issued against accused.</p>

<p> Other just and equitable remedies are likewise prayed for.</p>

<p>MOTION FOR RELEASE ON RECOGNIZANCE With Entry of Special Appearance</p>

<p> THE above-named child, through counsel, who hereby respectfully enters a special appearance solely for the purpose of securing his provisional liberty, unto this Honorable Court, invoking his special entitlement as a child under Philippine and international law, respectfully moves for his release on recognizance, on the ground that, to wit:</p>

<p>1. The child hereby respectfully applies for release on recognizance pursuant to the Rule on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law [Administrative Memorandum No. 02-1-18-SC], issued by the Honorable Supreme Court, providing for the following, thus, to wit: </p>

<p>&quot;Section 16. - When Bail A Matter of Right. - xxx However, where the juvenile does not pose a threat to public safety, the Family Court may, motu proprio or upon motion and recommendation of the DSWD, release the juvenile on recognizance to the custody of his parents or other responsible person.&quot;</p>

<p>2. This motion is also in line with Article 191 of Presidential Decree 603, otherwise known as the Child and Youth Welfare Code, as amended, and Section 8 of the Rules and Regulations on the Apprehension, Investigation, Prosecution and Rehabilitation of Youth Offenders, mandating law enforcers to divert and turn over children at the point of arrest to the custody of social workers and/or responsible members of the community, and Section 8 of Republic Act 8369 or the Family Courts Act of 1997, providing children with alternatives to imprisonment such as community continuum, counseling, conflict resolution seminars, essay writing, apology, community service, etc.;</p>

<p>3. The said child failed to post the required bail bond;</p>

<p>4. MRS. Name of Mother and/or other proposed custodian, mother of the said child, residing at ____________________________________, Manila, is willing to take the said child into her own custody pending the trial of this case;</p>

<p>6. The pertinent provisions of the Family Courts Act of 1997 (Republic Act 8369), together with its progenitor, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international instruments, accord special protection to children accused of violating the law;</p>

<p>7. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules), specifically Article 13.1 thereof, provides:</p>

<p>&quot;13. Detention Pending Trial. 13.1. Detention pending trial shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period.&quot;</p>

<p>8. By virtue of the Beijing Rules and in the advent of the Family Courts Act of 1997, detention should be undertaken by the state only as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest possible period;</p>

<p>9. Both international human rights law and Philippine laws mandate the state to observe the best interest of the child principle (UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) as well as the principle of diversion enshrined under Section 8 of the Family Courts Act of 1997 (RA 8369) and under Sections 4 (f-g) and Sections 20-24 of the Rule on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law as well as Article 11, Section 11.1 to 11.4 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules) in order to avoid the contact of children and youth with the criminal justice system which criminological findings show merely traumatize, criminalize, and alienate them from society.</p>

<p>3. That because I still have a balance on the purchase price in the amount of P500,000.00 which is payable within one (1) (year) from the date of signing thereof, it was stipulated in the aforementioned Deed that title and ownership over the subject property will only be transferred upon full payment of the same;</p>
